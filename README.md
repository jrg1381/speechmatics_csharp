# speechmatics_csharp
A simple (unsupported) C# example allowing you to upload jobs and view the results.  
There are two fully functioning apps with GUIs in here, one for transcription and one for alignment.  
Both use the same small class library for you to use in your own integrations.  
  
The code was written in Visual Studio and tested up to Windows 10, but we do not anticipate supporting it at present.  
Please regard the code as an incomplete example to get you started rather than a solution that will work for you 'out of the box'.  
  
There are pre-built binaries in Speechmatics.{Alignment|Transcription}/bin/Release/Speechmatics.{Alignment|Transcription}.exe that were compiled in Windows 8.1 which may help you quickstart.  
The code has also been tested and found to work in Windows 10 (if .net is update to 4.6).
